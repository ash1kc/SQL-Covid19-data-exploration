I have taken the COVID-19 dataset and performed an analysis of it. And I found some interesting insights.

## Tool used to perform analysis- Microsoft SQL Server Management studio

## SQL functions used-
1.  aggregation functions
2. sum, avg, min, max and count
3. order by, group by
4. logical functions AND and OR
5. subqueries
6. joins


# Key insights-

* At present there are total 4,46,70,646 infected cases and 5,30,586 deaths.
* In the month of April 2021,1% of India's population got infected.
* Cyprus has the highest infection count i.e. 68% of the Cyprus population got infected.
* The United States has the highest death count i.e. 10,77,031.
